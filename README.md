# Mailchimp Take Home, Jerry Pallath

`docker-compose up --build`

Hello!

I attempted to `npm i` the original FE directory that you gave me, but i kept getting a `node-pre-gyp` error. After a few attempts of trying to fix this, I felt like it would hinder my work, so I decided to make a very scrappy backend to handle it for me (nestjs and mongodb)

So please use the docker-compose file to run this.

I decided to use shadcn as a component library since it's been getting a lot of attention lately and I wanted to try a few components with it. All of the components from shadcn are located in the "@" folder, my original components are all in the "components" folder.
